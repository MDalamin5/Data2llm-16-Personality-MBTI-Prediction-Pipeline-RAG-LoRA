        "content": "The standard procedure for using Ampear tape, PIB (polyisobutylene) tape, and PVC tape during cable jointing — typically for low-voltage (LV) or control cable joints. These tapes serve insulation, moisture sealing, and mechanical protection purposes.\n⚡ 1. Surface Preparation\nIsolate the cable – Ensure power is OFF and cable is tested for zero voltage.\nClean the area – Remove dirt, grease, moisture, and loose insulation using a clean cloth and suitable solvent (isopropyl alcohol or approved cleaner).\nSmooth edges – If insulation or sheath is cut, taper or smooth sharp edges to avoid air pockets or stress points.\n🌀 2. Wrapping Sequence\n‌‌★Step 1: Apply Ampear Tape\nStart over the exposed conductor or insulation joint area.\nStretch the Ampear tape to about 2/3 of its original width while wrapping.\nOverlap each turn by 50%.\nCover slightly beyond both ends of the joint to ensure full insulation coverage.\nPress and smooth the surface to fuse layers.\n★Step 2: Apply PIB Tape\nBegin from one side of the joint, overlapping the Ampear tape by at least 10–20 mm.\nStretch the PIB tape to double its original length while applying with a half overlap.\nEnsure no air bubbles — PIB fuses into a homogeneous mass, creating a moisture barrier.\nCover the full joint area and extend slightly over the insulation.\n★Step 3: Apply PVC Tape\nWrap over the PIB layer for mechanical protection and appearance.\nApply with a 50% overlap, under moderate tension.\nExtend a bit beyond the PIB tape to seal the edges.\nMake two or three layers, ensuring a tight, neat finish.\n🧰 3. Finishing Checks\nEnsure no gaps, wrinkles, or trapped air.\nCheck that the final layer is firm, smooth, and well-adhered.\nThe joint should be water-tight, electrically insulated, and mechanically protected.\n⚠️ Safety Tips\nAvoid excessive stretching of PVC tape (it may peel back).\nFor outdoor or underground joints, apply additional protective wrapping (e.g., mastic or heat-shrink sleeve).\nhashtag\n#\ncableJoint\nhashtag\n#\nelectricalMaintenance\nhashtag\n#\nelectricalSafety\nhashtag\n#\nmaintenanceJob",
