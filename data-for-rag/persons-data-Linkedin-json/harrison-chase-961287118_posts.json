Like a human taking notes.\n✅ File operations that work:\nRead, write, and edit files in your project with diff previews and human approval. No more \"I can't access your filesystem.\"\n✅ Shell command execution\nRun tests, install packages, deploy code - all with your permission. Because we're not insane.\n✅ Multi-agent personalities\nCreate specialized agents (backend-dev, frontend-wizard, devops-guru) each with their own memory and expertise.\nGetting started is stupidly simple.\nJust install and run: pip install deepagents-cli && deepagents\nHarrison said they built this because copy-pasting context 47 times a day is insanity (we agree).\nCheck out the code, see the full toolset, and contribute on GitHub!\n♻️ Repost if you're done being your AI's memory bank",

You're not alone. Token limits are one of the biggest challenges in building production-ready AI applications.\nThe Problem: Long conversations hit token limits, forcing you to either:\n❌ Truncate early messages (losing context)\n❌ Manually manage conversation history\n❌ Accept degraded performance as context grows\nThe Solution: LangChain's new summarizationMiddleware automatically manages conversation memory by intelligently summarizing older messages while preserving recent context.\nWhy This Matters:\n✅ Zero Manual Work - Automatic token monitoring and summarization\n✅ Smart Preservation - Never breaks AI/Tool message pairs\n✅ Context Continuity - Maintains conversation flow seamlessly\nReal Impact: Our example shows a conversation going from ~6,000 tokens down to ~1,500 tokens (75% reduction!) while maintaining all the essential context. The agent can still reference earlier challenges and recommendations perfectly.\nPerfect for:\n🎯 Customer support chatbots with long sessions\n🎯 Code review assistants processing large codebases\n🎯 Research agents analyzing extensive documents\n🎯 Any multi-turn dialogue that needs persistent memory\nThis isn't just about staying under token limits—it's about building agents that can have truly long-form, meaningful conversations without losing their memory.\n📚 Read more in our new docs:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gdUW_aPS\nWhat's your biggest challenge with conversation memory in AI applications?\nhashtag\n#\nAI\nhashtag\n#\nLangChain\nhashtag\n#\nMachineLearning\nhashtag\n#\nChatbots\nhashtag\n#\nAgentDevelopment\nhashtag\n#\nOpenAI\nhashtag\n#\nAnthropic\nhashtag\n#\nagents",

Agents love to make excessive tool calls, especially when researching, and they don't always need those calls - or, you can't always afford the time or token cost to make them. 💵 ⏳\nI made ToolCallLimitMiddleware for my issue-triager-agent, which detects when the number of tool calls is over the limit, then removes tools from the agent and tells the agent that it's time to finish up. This middleware is particularly useful when I'm using models with lower rate limits, as I can easily lower their tool call limit.",

With this new integration, you can now train your LangGraph agents with reinforcement learning — making them smarter, more adaptive, and more efficient over time.\n✨ What this means in practice:\n* Agents learn to reason through multi-step problems without hand-holding\n* They improve tool usage automatically (no more prompt spaghetti)\n* They make smarter decisions in complex workflows\n* Training is scalable and robust, powered by ART’s reinforcement engine\nAnd the best part? It’s a drop-in upgrade:\n* Swap in ART’s init_chat_model and wrap_rollout\n* All interactions, tool calls, and reasoning chains get logged automatically\n* Plug straight into ART’s RULER reward function for training — no custom rewards needed\n💡 Imagine your LangGraph prototypes evolving into production-ready agents that actually get better with use. That’s the power of combining LangGraph’s agent framework with ART’s reinforcement learning.\n👉 Full docs & examples here:\nhttps://lnkd.in/gwWj-xxx\nCan’t wait to see what the community builds with this. If you’re experimenting with multi-step AI agents, give your agents the ability to learn from experience!",

DeepAgents is built on Claude Code's architecture - the same system that makes Anthropic's AI so powerful (see the post photo).\nThe genius \"Todo list tool\" that doesn't actually DO anything - just pure context engineering to keep agents focused until task completion.\nSetting up my 3 agents was STUPID SIMPLE:\nSearch Agent - \"Find events using search engines\"\nAnalysis Agent - \"Extract event details from URLs\"\nOrchestrator - \"Coordinate everything\"\nThat's literally the entire architecture definition.\nThe agent literally talks to itself through todos. Keeps perfect focus. Never gets distracted.\nSeriously - if you've been intimidating by multi-agent systems, those days are OVER.\nThis changes everything about building complex AI workflows.\nThe future isn't one AI doing everything poorly.
