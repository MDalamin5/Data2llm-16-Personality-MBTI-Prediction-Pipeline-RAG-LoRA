The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a clean, \"plug-and-play\" solution.\nBut many tutorials feel abstract, hiding how the model actually connects. My latest MCP Experiments-notebooks code pulls back the curtain by using the AI agent itself as the MCP client.\nUsing popular frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen, I show how simple it is to connect your agent to a universe of tools—no black boxes.\nWhat you'll learn from the code:\n- 🤖 Agent as the Client: See the direct agent-to-server communication.\n- 🔗 LangChain & AutoGen Ready: Plugs directly into your existing agentic workflows.\n- 🛠️ Custom MCP Servers: Easily wrap your own business logic or APIs into reusable tools.\n- 💡 Simplified Prompting: Call your custom tools based on clear business rules.\nCheck out the full implementation on GitHub:\nhttps://lnkd.in/grVUkZYg\nhashtag\n#\nAI\nhashtag\n#\nLLM\nhashtag\n#\nAgents\nhashtag\n#\nMCP\nhashtag\n#\nLangChain\nhashtag\n#\nAutoGen\nhashtag\n#\nOpenSource\nhashtag\n#\nArtificialIntelligence",

My system ingests PDFs, intelligently processes them, and generates context-aware answers by understanding visuals and text together.\nHere’s the core of the architecture (visualized in the diagram):\n- Unified Embeddings: Using OpenAI's CLIP, both text and images are mapped into a single vector space. This is key for true multimodal retrieval.\n-  Intelligent Retrieval: A FAISS vector store finds the most relevant text and image context for any user query.\n-  Vision-Powered Generation: The retrieved context is passed to a vision-capable LLM (Llama) to synthesize a comprehensive, accurate answer.\nThis was a challenging but rewarding build, bridging the gap between different data types for smarter AI.\nNotebook available in GitHub:\nhttps://lnkd.in/d3FXuTCz\nhashtag\n#\nMultiModelRAG\nhashtag\n#\nGenerativeAI\nhashtag\n#\nAI\nhashtag\n#\nLLM\nhashtag\n#\nCLIP\nhashtag\n#\nLlama\nhashtag\n#\nPython\nhashtag\n#\nLangChain\nhashtag\n#\nRAG\nhashtag\n#\nMachineLearning",

So I built one that's not just smart, but safe.\nIntroducing Analyzer GPT—an autonomous agent that writes, debugs, and executes data analysis code inside a secure Docker sandbox. 🛡️\nHere's the workflow:\n- You: Give it a dataset and a task.\n- AI Agent: Writes the Python code.\n- Secure Execution: The code is run inside an isolated Docker container. Zero risk to your host system.\n- Self-Correction: If the code fails (missing library, bug), the agent analyzes the error and fixes it, then reruns the code in the container.\nKey Features that make it a great project:\n- 🧠 Autonomous Debugging: The AI agent doesn't just write code; it reads error messages and intelligently debugs its own work.\n- 🔒 Secure Docker Sandbox: This is the core of the architecture. All AI-generated code is executed inside a fully isolated Docker container. This prevents any potential for malicious or accidental system access, a non-negotiable for production-ready agents.\n- 🤖 Collaborative Agents: Built with Microsoft's AutoGen, it features a specialist team of agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks.\n- 💻 Local & Private: Runs with a local Llama 3.1 model, ensuring complete data privacy.\nThis project demonstrates how to move from simple AI scripts to building sophisticated, reliable, and secure autonomous systems.\nIt’s an entire problem-solving loop that is both intelligent and secure by design. This is a crucial step towards building AI agents we can trust.\nI've open-sourced the entire modular project.

But when you integrate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — especially in a custom, developer-controlled way — the level of control and reliability you unlock is game-changing.\nIn my latest notebook, I explore two HITL implementations in LangGraph:\nWhat’s inside this experiment?\n** Custom HITL Implementation\n- I designed a mechanism where HITL doesn’t rely on the built-in LangGraph pause logic — instead, developers control when and how to pause using state logic and checkpoints. This gives greater flexibility, like dynamic condition-based intervention.\n** Built-in HITL Flow\n- For comparison, I also implemented the traditional LangGraph HITL with pause, showing how the same flow can be controlled automatically.\n** State update via user messages — simulating real-time human correction or approval.\n** Why is this useful?\n1. You can pause agents at decision points based on your custom rules (e.g., confidence, stage, error detection).\n2. Integrate human approvals, corrections, or steering without rebuilding the agent logic.\n3. Enable auditing or debugging of the agent's reasoning by stepping in mid-run.\n4. Build more trustworthy AI systems, especially for critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.\nIf you're working with LangGraph or building multi-agent systems, this HITL design gives you surgical control over agent reasoning.\nHuge thanks, Sunny Savita, for this great session.\nCode link:\nhttps://lnkd.in/g-2saPBu\nhashtag\n#\nLangGraph\nhashtag\n#\nHumanInTheLoop\nhashtag\n#\nAgenticAI\nhashtag\n#\nAIEngineering\nhashtag\n#\nLangChain\nhashtag\n#\nMultiAgentSystems\nhashtag\n#\nMCP\nhashtag\n#\nAIWorkflow\nhashtag\n#\nLLMOps",
