I find myself stopping across content that look imperfect at first glance but often contain useful information, in contrast to other posts that look very well organized with bullet points and carefully separated paragraphs. Why?\nAI. And I am so tired of it!\nYou take one look at the format and boom, you know that was AI generated. Notice how I wrote \"that was\" and not \"that it was\" in the previous line? I might be grammatically incorrect, but my folks know what my choice of words are when I am having a conversation. Thats what make me, me.\nWhich brings me to the point. Folks will argue that theres no harm in using AI productively, and honestly I use AI myself from time to time when I am in a tough spot. Some of my earlier LinkedIn posts were done with the help of AI albeit still somewhat edited and changed to suit my approach more.\nBut being completely reliant on AI? Generating every single post, every single email, every single Teams or Viber group comment? I draw the line when it is impossible to match the written material with the author.\nIf you work in a professional capacity, I KNOW that you have seen examples of the following scenario at your workplace. Sending an official mail written in AI, only to have the recipient copy the content of the first mail and paste it in ChatGPT with the keywords \"Generate a professional reply with the following points\" and then copy the AI generated response back into the Reply All thread. Where's the effort!\nFolks in social media using an AI generated image of themselves, with an AI generated caption using vocabulary that they themselves dont know the meaning of. Who are these people!\nI am getting severe AI fatigue at this point, and strongly feel like it is taking away our identity and replacing it with its own. We are losing our ability to THINK! Its easier to have AI draft a mail, or think of a clever name for an event than actually rack our brains to see if its possible for us to come up with it ourselves. And that bothers me.\nSo here's a request to the good people in my network. I propose we limit the use of AI in our lives. Write your own emails, generate your own posts. Make it lame, make it grammatically incorrect and riddled with spelling errors. But make it original. To HR personnel I will recommend adding a \"Written Test\" to your hiring pipeline where you provide them with a pen and paper to physically write an answer to a question.\nBecause its embarrassing to meet the author of a post/mail only to see that they cannot form two structured sentences together when conversing verbally.\nhashtag\n#\ncommunication\nhashtag\n#\nworkplace\nhashtag\n#\nAI\nhashtag\n#\nAI_fatigue\nhashtag\n#\nskynet",

It's never easy to miss time with loved ones during such a special occasion, but this is where the true spirit of WinBridge shines—we’ve built more than just a workplace; we’ve built a family.\nAnd here's what truly touched our hearts: our team members themselves arranged a heartfelt token of love for our office boys and asked us to hand it over on their behalf. That simple act of kindness reminded us—this is what a real family looks like. Compassion, care, and unity.\nWe celebrate together. We support each other. And we grow as one.\nMay Allah bless all our employees with good health, happiness, and continued success.\nFrom our family to yours, here's wishing you a joyful and peaceful Eid.\nhashtag\n#\nEidMubarak\nhashtag\n#\nTeamWinBridge\nhashtag\n#\nGratitude\nhashtag\n#\nCompanyCulture\nhashtag\n#\nTogetherWeGrow\nhashtag\n#\nTogetherWeWin\nhashtag\n#\nTogetherWeWin\nEid Mubarak from the WinBridge Family!",
