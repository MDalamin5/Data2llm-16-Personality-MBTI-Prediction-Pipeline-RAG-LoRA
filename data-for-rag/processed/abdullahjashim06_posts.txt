hashtag
#
Pre_commissioning
:
The primary goal of pre-commissioning was to prepare the plant for commissioning by ensuring everything was in place and ready for testing.
It typically began after the construction of the plant was completed. My team was involved in verifying that all the components, systems and equipment are installed correctly and in accordance with the PID design specifications.
Key steps in pre-commissioning involved:
Mechanical Completion, Document & Design review, Equipment inspection, Instrument Calibration, System check, Cleaning and Flushing, Leak Testing
hashtag
#
Commissioning
:
Commissioning is the phase where the plant is brought online and tested to ensure that it operates safely, efficiently, and in accordance with design specifications.
Our primary objective in commissioning phase was to verify the performance of individual systems and the overall integration of the plant.
Key steps in commissioning involved:
System Testing, Functional Testing, Loop Checks, Integrated System Tests, Performance Testing, Safety Testing
hashtag
#
Start_up
:
With safety as our top priority, we initiated the startup process, starting with utilities such as medium pressure steam, low-pressure steam, cooling water, and nitrogen gas. We meticulously followed startup procedures, optimizing process parameters to achieve peak performance.
Key steps in Start-up involved:
Preparation, Safety check, System check, Utilities startup, Process startup, Testing and Optimization, Ramp-up, Stabilization, Documentation.
Highlights of my
