Post 1: The standard procedure for using Ampear tape, PIB (polyisobutylene) tape, and PVC tape during cable jointing — typically for low-voltage (LV) or control cable joints. These tapes serve insulation, moisture sealing, and mechanical protection purposes.
⚡ 1. Surface Preparation
Isolate the cable – Ensure power is OFF and cable is tested for zero voltage.
Clean the area – Remove dirt, grease, moisture, and loose insulation using a clean cloth and suitable solvent (isopropyl alcohol or approved cleaner).
Smooth edges – If insulation or sheath is cut, taper or smooth sharp edges to avoid air pockets or stress points.
🌀 2. Wrapping Sequence
‌‌★Step 1: Apply Ampear Tape
Start over the exposed conductor or insulation joint area.
Stretch the Ampear tape to about 2/3 of its original width while wrapping.
Overlap each turn by 50%.
Cover slightly beyond both ends of the joint to ensure full insulation coverage.
Press and smooth the surface to fuse layers.
★Step 2: Apply PIB Tape
Begin from one side of the joint, overlapping the Ampear tape by at least 10–20 mm.
Stretch the PIB tape to double its original length while applying with a half overlap.
Ensure no air bubbles — PIB fuses into a homogeneous mass, creating a moisture barrier.
Cover the full joint area and extend slightly over the insulation.
★Step 3: Apply PVC Tape
Wrap over the PIB layer for mechanical protection and appearance.
Apply with a 50% overlap, under moderate tension.
Extend a bit beyond the PIB tape to seal the edges.
Make two or three layers, ensuring a tight, neat finish.
🧰 3. Finishing Checks
Ensure no gaps, wrinkles, or trapped air.
Check that the final layer is firm, smooth, and well-adhered.
The joint should be water-tight, electrically insulated, and mechanically protected.
⚠️ Safety Tips
Avoid excessive stretching of PVC tape (it may peel back).
For outdoor or underground joints, apply additional protective wrapping (e.g., mastic or heat-shrink sleeve).

Post 3: Recently I successfully completed two residential electrical drawing projects! This is a meaningful step forward in my career.
From the initial design to the final implementation, I try to ensure an efficient, and reliable power system by meticulously calculating the electrical load, determining the appropriate size for substations, and specifying the correct generator capacity.
Every symbol, circuit, and outlet in drawing taught me something new—and reminded me how much there is still to learn.
I am grateful to my mentors for guiding me and sharing their knowledge.
Here’s to many more projects, continued growth, and a deeper understanding of the craft. ⚡

Post 7: Earthing is generally defined as “The process of transferring the immediate discharge of electrical energy directly to the earth with the help of the low resistance wire is known as the electrical earthing. The electrical earthing is done by connecting the non-current carrying part of the equipment or neutral of the supply system to the ground. "

Post 8: The most significant difference between a recloser and a breaker is that the recloser was designed as a self-controlled device. Standards have been established and capabilities determined within the characteristics of the integral control scheme of the recloser.
Because a breaker was designed for use with a separate relay/control scheme, a breaker must be defined and rated for a wide variety of relay/control sequences.
