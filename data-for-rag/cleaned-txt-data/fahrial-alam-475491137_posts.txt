I find myself stopping across content that look imperfect at first glance but often contain useful information, in contrast to other posts that look very well organized with bullet points and carefully separated paragraphs. Why? AI. And I am so tired of it! You take one look at the format and boom, you know that was AI generated. Notice how I wrote "that was" and not "that it was" in the previous line? I might be grammatically incorrect, but my folks know what my choice of words are when I am having a conversation. Thats what make me, me. Which brings me to the point. Folks will argue that theres no harm in using AI productively, and honestly I use AI myself from time to time when I am in a tough spot. Some of my earlier LinkedIn posts were done with the help of AI albeit still somewhat edited and changed to suit my approach more. But being completely reliant on AI? Generating every single post, every single email, every single Teams or Viber group comment? I draw the line when it is impossible to match the written material with the author. If you work in a professional capacity, I KNOW that you have seen examples of the following scenario at your workplace. Sending an official mail written in AI, only to have the recipient copy the content of the first mail and paste it in ChatGPT with the keywords "Generate a professional reply with the following points" and then copy the AI generated response back into the Reply All thread. Where's the effort! Folks in social media using an AI generated image of themselves, with an AI generated caption using vocabulary that they themselves dont know the meaning of. Who are these people! I am getting severe AI fatigue at this point, and strongly feel like it is taking away our identity and replacing it with its own. We are losing our ability to THINK! Its easier to have AI draft a mail, or think of a clever name for an event than actually rack our brains to see if its possible for us to come up with it ourselves. And that bothers me. So here's a request to the good people in my network. I propose we limit the use of AI in our lives. Write your own emails, generate your own posts. Make it lame, make it grammatically incorrect and riddled with spelling errors. But make it original. To HR personnel I will recommend adding a "Written Test" to your hiring pipeline where you provide them with a pen and paper to physically write an answer to a question. Because its embarrassing to meet the author of a post/mail only to see that they cannot form two structured sentences together when conversing verbally. hashtag # communication hashtag # workplace hashtag # AI hashtag # AI_fatigue hashtag # skynet Images: None Post 2: Be a part of a historic project for Walton and Bangladesh.

At WinBridge, we believe that the strength of our company lies in the unity and dedication of our team. As Eid approaches, we wanted to do something special—though it was a last-minute initiative, our Admin & HR teams went the extra mile to arrange a small token of appreciation for our incredible team members and their families. While most companies in Bangladesh will enjoy a long holiday during Eid, our journey continues as we work alongside our U.S. clients. It's never easy to miss time with loved ones during such a special occasion, but this is where the true spirit of WinBridge shines—we’ve built more than just a workplace; we’ve built a family. And here's what truly touched our hearts: our team members themselves arranged a heartfelt token of love for our office boys and asked us to hand it over on their behalf. That simple act of kindness reminded us—this is what a real family looks like. Compassion, care, and unity. We celebrate together. We support each other. And we grow as one. May Allah bless all our employees with good health, happiness, and continued success. From our family to yours, here's wishing you a joyful and peaceful Eid. hashtag # EidMubarak hashtag # TeamWinBridge hashtag # Gratitude hashtag # CompanyCulture hashtag # TogetherWeGrow hashtag # TogetherWeWin hashtag # TogetherWeWin Eid Mubarak from the WinBridge Family!

So, what’s your next step? Well, once you understand the product, the logical move is to focus on who you’re selling to. Here’s how you can break it down: ✅ Identify the target group that needs your product the most. ✅ Check if your clients are already using similar solutions. ✅ Look into the competitors—what sectors are they dominating? ✅ Assess if your product helps lower your client's overhead costs. ✅ Determine if your product supports the client’s compliance needs. Once you answer these key questions, you’ll have a shortlist of companies in front of you—and one of them is bound to be your next client! 🎯✨ hashtag # SalesStrategy hashtag # KnowYourClient hashtag # ManufacturingSales hashtag # BusinessDevelopment hashtag # SalesSuccess hashtag # SellYourWayOut Images: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEkSSUOw8gFmQ/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1728894309257?e=1764806400&v=beta&t=7fy6ynjpz5mkZiPWT2UGdcL5D3TmbKwfP60RqTQgjTs Post 18: Red doesn't always mean huat.
