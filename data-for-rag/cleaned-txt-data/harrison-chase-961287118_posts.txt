I’m looking for people who can code like engineers and communicate like partners. Builders who love solving complex problems and working directly with customers. We're building an elite team of deeply technical, customer obsessed folks. If you’re excited about deploying real LLM and agent systems in production, let’s talk. Reach out over DM or apply here! https://lnkd.in/gNE2VYut Images: None Post 2: I haven't written a line of code in over a year. My output has 10x'd. This is what happens when you stop thinking about coding agents tools as copilots and start treating them as Deep Agents. What nobody tells you is most people are using these tools wrong 😉 - They're still writing code with AI instead of through AI. - They haven't learned Context Engineering or created custom slash commands to automate their processes. - They're not leveraging multiple background agents that scale work while they think. - They don't understand the taxonomy of autonomy—from L0 (manual) to L4 (full YOLO mode). We're running a track at Google Cloud Day where you'll see exactly how Agentic Coding works in real development workflows. Real systems. Real teams. Real ROI. We'll see production stacks in action. We'll break down best practices for working with Coding Agents, explore how they're implemented within the Deep Agents framework, and discuss: what they can do what they can't what they shouldn't 🙂 With incredible speakers from: monday.com , Qodo , LangTalks , Wix , Wiz , Tenzai we're going to understand the fundamental shift in how software gets built.

LangChain just dropped the cure: DeepAgents CLI with actual persistent memory. This project solves the most infuriating problem in AI development, agents that forget everything the moment you close your terminal. It gives your AI assistant an actual memory that persists across sessions. Key Features: ✅ True persistent memory Your agent writes markdown notes to ~/.deepagents/memories/ and reads them before every response. Like a human taking notes. ✅ File operations that work: Read, write, and edit files in your project with diff previews and human approval. No more "I can't access your filesystem." ✅ Shell command execution Run tests, install packages, deploy code - all with your permission. Because we're not insane. ✅ Multi-agent personalities Create specialized agents (backend-dev, frontend-wizard, devops-guru) each with their own memory and expertise. Getting started is stupidly simple. Just install and run: pip install deepagents-cli && deepagents Harrison said they built this because copy-pasting context 47 times a day is insanity (we agree). Check out the code, see the full toolset, and contribute on GitHub! ♻️ Repost if you're done being your AI's memory bank Images: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEqXYUNyqPQHA/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZphdasqH8Ag-/0/1762571693340?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=vamnsTwPbvsyxACT7zilpU9h7vwdmE-5BZZtBy1woXw Post 4: New Chat LangChain just dropped (Now Faster, Smarter, and Better Looking)!

Together with Marco Perini (Deployed Engineer, LangChain), they unpacked what it really takes to build AI Agents that work in production, and why building trust in these systems requires as much discipline and iteration as innovation. From early hand-coded loops to fine-tuned custom models and real-world reliability, the conversation showed just how fast the field is evolving — and what it takes to keep up.

LangChain now supports middleware hooks that let you intercept, observe, or modify every step of an agent’s reasoning loop: 🧠 beforeAgent / afterAgent – pre- and post-invocation logic 💬 beforeModel / afterModel – wrap or monitor model calls 🧰 wrapToolCall – control how tools are executed ⚙️ wrapModelCall – add retries, caching, or fallbacks That means you can now: - add human-in-the-loop approvals 🙋 - summarize long conversations or tool results 🧾 - redact PII 🔒 - switch models or prompts dynamically ⚡️ - or even limit tool calls to prevent runaway costs 💸 Think of it as plugins for your AI agents — as flexible and composable as in Vite, Express.js or Next.js, but for reasoning loops instead of HTTP requests.

Searching for "B2B SaaS, 501-1000 employees, uses Salesforce" is just commoditized and targeted spam. OpenFunnel is a time-aware search engine for insights and activities in your target segment - that reveal pain. You can search for activities like: "Find companies looking to implement usage-based billing" "Find companies that moved from OpenAI to self-hosted models in the last 3-6 months" "Find companies who updated their pricing page to introduce an enterprise plan in the last 3 months" OpenFunnel continuously monitors these time-based signals, delivering actionable insights daily, giving you the fastest, unique insights that your competitors miss out on. Over 1000+ users are already discovering prospects through pain-first search, including some of the fastest-growing companies like Central, Mintlify, and Everest Systems. Congrats on the launch, Fenil Suchak and Aditya Lahiri ! https://lnkd.in/gP3yJ7pR Images: None Post 18: 🧠 Solving the Memory Problem: Introducing LangChain's Summarization Middleware in LangChain v1 alpha! Ever built an AI agent that "forgets" important context when conversations get too long? You're not alone. Token limits are one of the biggest challenges in building production-ready AI applications. The Problem: Long conversations hit token limits, forcing you to either: ❌ Truncate early messages (losing context) ❌ Manually manage conversation history ❌ Accept degraded performance as context grows The Solution: LangChain's new summarizationMiddleware automatically manages conversation memory by intelligently summarizing older messages while preserving recent context. Why This Matters: ✅ Zero Manual Work - Automatic token monitoring and summarization ✅ Smart Preservation - Never breaks AI/Tool message pairs ✅ Context Continuity - Maintains conversation flow seamlessly Real Impact: Our example shows a conversation going from ~6,000 tokens down to ~1,500 tokens (75% reduction!) while maintaining all the essential context. The agent can still reference earlier challenges and recommendations perfectly. Perfect for: 🎯 Customer support chatbots with long sessions 🎯 Code review assistants processing large codebases 🎯 Research agents analyzing extensive documents 🎯 Any multi-turn dialogue that needs persistent memory This isn't just about staying under token limits—it's about building agents that can have truly long-form, meaningful conversations without losing their memory. 📚 Read more in our new docs: https://lnkd.in/gdUW_aPS What's your biggest challenge with conversation memory in AI applications? hashtag # AI hashtag # LangChain hashtag # MachineLearning hashtag # Chatbots hashtag # AgentDevelopment hashtag # OpenAI hashtag # Anthropic hashtag # agents Images: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHCDIHRXkAQYg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56ZlTZmh9HUA0-/0/1758040846746?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=yogKzz5lw3h77K7Mt0-mXRs_72LFhqY3WWSB7wuvBQE Post 19: LangChain's Agent Middleware is here! 🚀 Developers need more control over agent behavior for optimal context engineering. LangChain 1.0's new middleware gives you that control while keeping the core agent loop simple (model x tools). Our latest release comes with a few builtin primitives, including: 💁‍♂️ Human-in-the-loop: get user feedback (approve, modify, deny) before executing expensive or risky tools 🏖️ Summarization: summarize message history to avoid context overflow for long conversations 🧱 Anthropic prompt caching: optimize cost for long and repetitive prompts Blog: https://lnkd.in/eGrJWE_z Docs: https://lnkd.in/ejusf3AP Images: None Post 20: 🤝Adding human-in-the-loop to deep agents Many tools that you may want to give to agents will take actions in the real world. For these tools, you will often want to add "human-in-the-loop" steps - require a human user to approve, edit, or respond to their request to execute that tool. In this video, we will see how to add and use human-in-the-loop functionality to Deep Agents Video: https://lnkd.in/gfbjdABH Deep Agents Github: https://lnkd.in/gWpaj88j Images: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQG_8Xf4OGjPHQ/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZlOlrVbJsAk-/0/1757960124881?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=4_V04OocF4jIi9ud0RZEBLL_VzPV0Ka8v6tGXsWOFxM Post 21: Langchain v1 now has the concept of "middleware" for agents - hooks to run before or after the LLM call. One way to use middleware is to limit the number of tool calls that an agent can make. Agents love to make excessive tool calls, especially when researching, and they don't always need those calls - or, you can't always afford the time or token cost to make them. 💵 ⏳ I made ToolCallLimitMiddleware for my issue-triager-agent, which detects when the number of tool calls is over the limit, then removes tools from the agent and tells the agent that it's time to finish up. This middleware is particularly useful when I'm using models with lower rate limits, as I can easily lower their tool call limit.

If you’ve ever built multi-step, ReAct-style agents, you know the pain: endless prompt tweaking, fragile reasoning, and lots of manual trial-and-error. With this new integration, you can now train your LangGraph agents with reinforcement learning — making them smarter, more adaptive, and more efficient over time. ✨ What this means in practice: * Agents learn to reason through multi-step problems without hand-holding * They improve tool usage automatically (no more prompt spaghetti) * They make smarter decisions in complex workflows * Training is scalable and robust, powered by ART’s reinforcement engine And the best part? It’s a drop-in upgrade: * Swap in ART’s init_chat_model and wrap_rollout * All interactions, tool calls, and reasoning chains get logged automatically * Plug straight into ART’s RULER reward function for training — no custom rewards needed 💡 Imagine your LangGraph prototypes evolving into production-ready agents that actually get better with use. That’s the power of combining LangGraph’s agent framework with ART’s reinforcement learning. 👉 Full docs & examples here: https://lnkd.in/gwWj-xxx Can’t wait to see what the community builds with this. If you’re experimenting with multi-step AI agents, give your agents the ability to learn from experience! Images: None Post 26: This is the EASIEST way to build multi-agent systems these days. I'm not kidding. I just built a complex AI system with 3 specialized agents in 20 minutes. An open source event hunter - finds your perfect tech events in 60 seconds. No more endless Google searches. No more missing CFP deadlines. No more outdated event sites. All thanks to Harrison Chase 's new DeepAgents library 🤯 Here's how RIDICULOUSLY EASY this was: 3 lines of code, system prompts, connection to Bright Data 's MCP. That's it. from deepagents import create_deep_agent agent = create_deep_agent( tools=mcp_tools, instructions="Find tech events", subagents=[search_agent, details_agent] ) BOOM. Multi-agent system is up and running. The secret sauce? DeepAgents is built on Claude Code's architecture - the same system that makes Anthropic's AI so powerful (see the post photo). The genius "Todo list tool" that doesn't actually DO anything - just pure context engineering to keep agents focused until task completion. Setting up my 3 agents was STUPID SIMPLE: Search Agent - "Find events using search engines" Analysis Agent - "Extract event details from URLs" Orchestrator - "Coordinate everything" That's literally the entire architecture definition. The agent literally talks to itself through todos. Keeps perfect focus. Never gets distracted. Seriously - if you've been intimidating by multi-agent systems, those days are OVER. This changes everything about building complex AI workflows. The future isn't one AI doing everything poorly. It's specialized AI teams working together brilliantly. And now it's EASY to build.

Note: Research queries take quite a long time, so the video only shows the beginning of the process. I will make a proper video if I get around to building a more interesting custom deepagents implementation.

For both, first create an MCP client pointing at the MCP servers: client = MultiServerMCPClient({ "itinerary": { "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/", "transport": "streamable_http", }}) Then either: 1) Use the prebuilt react agent from langgraph.prebuilt: tools = await client.get_tools() agent = create_react_agent(model, tools) hotel_response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "Find me a hotel in SF for 2 nights starting from 2024-01-01 with WiFi and pool."}) 2) Set up the entire graph yourself, so that you have full control on the flow: tools = await client.get_tools() def call_model(state: MessagesState): response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(state["messages"]) return {"messages": response} builder = StateGraph(MessagesState) builder.add_node(call_model) builder.add_node(ToolNode(tools)) builder.add_edge(START, "call_model") builder.add_conditional_edges( "call_model", tools_condition, ) builder.add_edge("tools", "call_model") graph = builder.compile() hotel_response = await graph.ainvoke({"messages": "Find me a hotel in SF for 2 nights starting from 2024-01-01 with WiFI and pool."}) See full examples here, which include model configuration for either Azure OpenAI or GitHub Models: https://lnkd.in/gHxXDvwy https://lnkd.in/ghU5snwK See docs for langchain-mcp-adapters here: Images: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHG45waD0sygw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZhSsILTHkAk-/0/1753733956609?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=vYqSEn3MCzsfjHAZ-Rzs0yIt8O2mWax9aW_yWLoBH1g, https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHmczNxlwNJmg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZhSsIMiHMAg-/0/1753733957124?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=AlmFr-MKNx1z_92MhJ63PSnwoHT-JbzV_rGJda9H0YE
