Hiring global talents is becoming essential, not optional. Yet there are still many myths surrounding global software teams when it comes to: - Quality - Communication - Collaboration - And more... That simply aren’t true! There are a lot of assumptions that need debunking. Swipe to uncover why and if you have additional insights, drop them in the comments. I’d love to learn more from you. Images: None Post 2: hashtag # WebSummit2025 is just around the corner, and honestly, it already feels like a whirlwind. Just finished running our own tech event in Bergen, Norway, and now, only a month later, I’m already packing for Lisbon. I’ve never been to Lisbon before, and I’ve never been to Web Summit either. But the more I learned about it, the more I felt that mix of nerves and excitement. I’m really looking forward to meeting new people, hearing fresh ideas, and just soaking in all the energy that comes with being surrounded by people who love tech and innovation as much as we do. I’ll be there on behalf of Craftsmen from November 10th to 13th. To connecting, learning, and hopefully bringing back a few good stories to share. If you’re going too, or if you have any must-visit tips for Lisbon, drop me a message. Would love to catch up or just grab a coffee somewhere in between all the chaos.

For me, growth is everything. When people grow …. they shine. Not just as professionals, But as humans, team players, and leaders in the making. That’s why at Craftsmen learning and development aren’t perks, they’re our foundation. Every year, we try to welcome 10–15 trainee software engineers. They spend their first 3–6 months in our in-house academy Craftsmen Excellence Academy Where they learn, build, collaborate, and grow. We train them technically. We align them culturally. We help them think beyond code. We help them discover the true beauty of ownership, empathy, and excellence. Because my purpose is simple! I want my people to grow. And now, it’s that time of year again. We’re hiring those who want to grow, give, and make an impact. If you’re hungry to learn, driven to build, and ready to grow… your journey might start here. Images: None Post 4: This one principle forced me to become an entrepreneur From a passionate software engineer. Many companies prioritize profit, often at the expense of their employees' well-being, but I set out to build a company rooted in empathy. A place created by developers, for developers, with people at its heart. I care deeply about people. - Where clients felt supported - Where developers could thrive - Where relationships truly mattered Years ago, one of my European clients hit a big hurdle. Their business was struggling, and I could see the worry. - I stepped in - Promising to help - With our special care package (our own hardship support model for clients) - For next 6-months Because our clients aren’t just clients. Our clients’ struggles are always our struggles. Even when our budgets were thin, we helped them navigate their challenges. And we’re still proudly working side by side. Today, I’m proud to say I've created something really special: A people-centric company that truly serves both clients and teams equally. And I can see the result: - People usually stick with my company - Low employee turnover - Our clients tend to stay and grow with us And I believe that’s the result of caring beyond the bottom line. What do you think? Is empathy the winning edge in business?

But let’s be real It’s all just talk until things go south. That’s how long I’ve seen companies rise and fall. And I’m revealing a truth I’ve wanted to speak about for years. Why do companies fail? Some companies I knew didn’t fail because of- - Bad products - Tough competition They failed because they couldn’t build a company with a culture worth staying for. They always thought culture had no impact on performance. Look, people won’t stay forever only for the paycheck! Clients won’t stay only for the service! And a toxic culture always- - Drives high employee turnover - Pushes clients away - Most importantly, it kills trust And when a company gets culture right? - Ownership rises - Collaboration strengthens - Trust becomes the foundation Because at the end of the day, culture isn’t about how a company looks on social media. It’s about how it feels to be there. That’s why fixing your culture should always come first. Because when culture is right, performance naturally improves. So, I'd love to know what “ONE” thing about your company’s culture makes you want to stay there?

The summit is happening tomorrow at 1:00 PM in Bergen. It’s been a wild ride from the start to now. What started as an idea in my head is now turning into reality. Months of coordinating across time zones, building an agenda, and making sure every detail is in place. And now, it’s finally go time. From the very beginning, we set out to design something more than just a usual meetup. We wanted to create a space where people from different corners of the world could share their real stories and experiences. For me, the most exciting part is the diversity of perspectives that will come together in one room. The kind of conversations that remind us why technology has no borders, only bridges. I can’t wait to feel the energy in that room: leaders, innovators, and curious minds, all gathered in Bergen. If you’re in Bergen, I’d love to see you tomorrow at the summit. If you’re not, no worries… I’ll be sharing updates along the way so you don’t miss anything. See you all tomorrow!

They buy "relief" And the solutions that give their business a chance to breathe again. Your offer is not the reason someone says “yes.” Their pain is. Because no one wakes up thinking, “I need to buy a 3-month consulting package.” They wake up thinking, “I can’t afford to waste another quarter stuck in this mess.” So they don’t care how your offer works. Until they believe it will work for their business. They’re buying: - Your clarity about the real business problem - Your care for their growth and outcomes - The quality of thinking, service, and presence you bring - And yes, your ability to make complexity feel solvable The features of your service? Those are just logistics. What they want is certainty, momentum, and a sense that they’re finally in good hands. Sell that. And you’ll never have to “pitch” again.

It's something you won’t feel until It’s already holding your team back. Scaling is always important. But the way most startups approach it? It’s the silent risk... Because scaling isn’t just about adding talent. It’s about protecting alignment. And every misaligned hire? A silent tax on your future. And once you lose that alignment… You’ll feel it in every - Sprint - Missed milestone - Frustrated standup So why do you keep hiring like it’s just a numbers game? Swipe through for some deeper insights. If you find them valuable, give it a repost! Let's help others in your community avoid the same mistakes.
