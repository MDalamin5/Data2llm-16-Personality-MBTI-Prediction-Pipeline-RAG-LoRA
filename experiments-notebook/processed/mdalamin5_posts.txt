Post 1: Tired of the tangled mess of custom AI tool integrations? The Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a clean, "plug-and-play" solution.
But many tutorials feel abstract, hiding how the model actually connects. My latest MCP Experiments-notebooks code pulls back the curtain by using the AI agent itself as the MCP client.
Using popular frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen, I show how simple it is to connect your agent to a universe of tools—no black boxes.
What you'll learn from the code:
- 🤖 Agent as the Client: See the direct agent-to-server communication.
- 🔗 LangChain & AutoGen Ready: Plugs directly into your existing agentic workflows.
- 🛠️ Custom MCP Servers: Easily wrap your own business logic or APIs into reusable tools.
- 💡 Simplified Prompting: Call your custom tools based on clear business rules.

Post 2: Excited to share my latest project: a Multi-Model RAG pipeline that understands both text and images in complex documents! 🚀
The future of AI is multimodal, and this project tackles that head-on. My system ingests PDFs, intelligently processes them, and generates context-aware answers by understanding visuals and text together.
Here’s the core of the architecture (visualized in the diagram):
- Unified Embeddings: Using OpenAI's CLIP, both text and images are mapped into a single vector space. This is key for true multimodal retrieval.
-  Intelligent Retrieval: A FAISS vector store finds the most relevant text and image context for any user query.
-  Vision-Powered Generation: The retrieved context is passed to a vision-capable LLM (Llama) to synthesize a comprehensive, accurate answer.
This was a challenging but rewarding build, bridging the gap between different data types for smarter AI.

Post 3: You're right to be cautious about AI agents running code on your machine. So I built one that's not just smart, but safe.
Introducing Analyzer GPT—an autonomous agent that writes, debugs, and executes data analysis code inside a secure Docker sandbox. 🛡️
Here's the workflow:
- You: Give it a dataset and a task.
- AI Agent: Writes the Python code.
- Secure Execution: The code is run inside an isolated Docker container. Zero risk to your host system.
- Self-Correction: If the code fails (missing library, bug), the agent analyzes the error and fixes it, then reruns the code in the container.
Key Features that make it a great project:
- 🧠 Autonomous Debugging: The AI agent doesn't just write code; it reads error messages and intelligently debugs its own work.
- 🔒 Secure Docker Sandbox: This is the core of the architecture. All AI-generated code is executed inside a fully isolated Docker container. This prevents any potential for malicious or accidental system access, a non-negotiable for production-ready agents.
- 🤖 Collaborative Agents: Built with Microsoft's AutoGen, it features a specialist team of agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks.
- 💻 Local & Private: Runs with a local Llama 3.1 model, ensuring complete data privacy.
This project demonstrates how to move from simple AI scripts to building sophisticated, reliable, and secure autonomous systems.
It’s an entire problem-solving loop that is both intelligent and secure by design. This is a crucial step towards building AI agents we can trust.
I've open-sourced the entire modular project. See how the secure execution is integrated:

Post 4: What if you could pause your AI agent at the perfect moment and guide it like a director on set?
Agentic AI workflows are already powerful. But when you integrate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — especially in a custom, developer-controlled way — the level of control and reliability you unlock is game-changing.
In my latest notebook, I explore two HITL implementations in LangGraph:
What’s inside this experiment?
** Custom HITL Implementation
- I designed a mechanism where HITL doesn’t rely on the built-in LangGraph pause logic — instead, developers control when and how to pause using state logic and checkpoints. This gives greater flexibility, like dynamic condition-based intervention.
** Built-in HITL Flow
- For comparison, I also implemented the traditional LangGraph HITL with pause, showing how the same flow can be controlled automatically.
** State update via user messages — simulating real-time human correction or approval.
** Why is this useful?
1. You can pause agents at decision points based on your custom rules (e.g., confidence, stage, error detection).
2. Integrate human approvals, corrections, or steering without rebuilding the agent logic.
3. Enable auditing or debugging of the agent's reasoning by stepping in mid-run.
4. Build more trustworthy AI systems, especially for critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.
If you're working with LangGraph or building multi-agent systems, this HITL design gives you surgical control over agent reasoning.
Huge thanks, Sunny Savita, for this great session.

Post 7: 🚀 New Project: Fine-Grained Feature Imitation for Efficient Object Detection Using Knowledge Distillation 🔍
Excited to share my latest project on efficient object detection using knowledge distillation! 🎯
📌 Challenge:
State-of-the-art object detection models are highly accurate but computationally heavy, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices.
📌 Solution:
I developed a fine-grained feature imitation approach that enables a lightweight student model to learn from a larger teacher model, improving detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size.
📊 Key Results:
✅ Student Model: 1.78M parameters (71% fewer than the teacher model)
✅ mAP@50: 0.707 (↑6.3% improvement)
✅ mAP@50-95: 0.435 (↑5% improvement)
✅ Generalization across multiple datasets: Pascal VOC, BCCD, Lemon Disease, Incorrect Mask-2
🔬 Technical Highlights:
🔹 Used YOLOv5x as the teacher & YOLOv5n as the student
🔹 Designed a fine-grained imitation mask to focus on key regions
🔹 Implemented a Combined Imitation Loss Function (CILF) for better knowledge transfer
💡 Why It Matters?
This approach allows real-time object detection on low-power devices, making it suitable for autonomous systems, medical imaging, and smart surveillance—without requiring specialized hardware!
