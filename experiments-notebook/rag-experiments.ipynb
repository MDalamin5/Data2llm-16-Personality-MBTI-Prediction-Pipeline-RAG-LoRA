But when you integrate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — especially in a custom, developer-controlled way — the level of control and reliability you unlock is game-changing.\\nIn my latest notebook, I explore two HITL implementations in LangGraph:\\nWhat’s inside this experiment?\\n** Custom HITL Implementation\\n- I designed a mechanism where HITL doesn’t rely on the built-in LangGraph pause logic — instead, developers control when and how to pause using state logic and checkpoints. This gives greater flexibility, like dynamic condition-based intervention.\\n** Built-in HITL Flow\\n- For comparison, I also implemented the traditional LangGraph HITL with pause, showing how the same flow can be controlled automatically.\\n** State update via user messages — simulating real-time human correction or approval.\\n** Why is this useful?\\n1. You can pause agents at decision points based on your custom rules (e.g., confidence, stage, error detection).\\n2. Integrate human approvals, corrections, or steering without rebuilding the agent logic.\\n3. Enable auditing or debugging of the agent\\'s reasoning by stepping in mid-run.\\n4. Build more trustworthy AI systems, especially for critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.\\nIf you\\'re working with LangGraph or building multi-agent systems, this HITL design gives you surgical control over agent reasoning.\\nHuge thanks,\\xa0Sunny Savita,\\xa0for this great session.\\nCode link:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/g-2saPBu\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangGraph\\nhashtag\\n#\\nHumanInTheLoop\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAgenticAI\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIEngineering\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangChain\\nhashtag\\n#\\nMultiAgentSystems\\nhashtag\\n#\\nMCP\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIWorkflow\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLLMOps\\nImages: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGIvunwYS0Tlg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56Zf6YaTWGUAk-/0/1752252393624?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=2LcTlpMnU5QiQBw7k2kJ6qkc-KbQLUWzSkZTDV_xGp8\\n\\nPost 5: Just completed one of the most complex projects I\\'ve worked on: an Autonomous Research Agent powered by the Hierarchical Supervisor Pattern!\\n🔍 What it does:\\n- Handles user queries end-to-end: Research → Summarize → Export\\n- Smart task routing with a top-level supervisor agent\\nTwo core teams:\\n- Research Team (Medical/Finance) using tools like Tavily & PubMed\\n- Document Processor that rewrites, summarizes & saves to PDF/DOCX\\n🛠 Tech Stack:\\n- LangGraph + LangChain tools\\n- Groq + Qwen model for fast reasoning\\n- Pydantic for structured task selection\\n- Custom tools for local file export\\n💡 Built it to explore real-world agent orchestration — and it works!\\n🔗 GitHub-notebook:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/gtz2jDq2\\nHuge thanks to\\nSunny Savita\\nand\\nKrish Naik\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangGraph\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLLM\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangChain\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIagent\\nhashtag\\n#\\nGroq\\nhashtag\\n#\\nPython\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAutonomousAgents\\nImages: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEYLp_mB4eYzw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZfRKZZcHoAk-/0/1751560853775?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=PtGcSm4BWRN2prLZr9JDgk2pQCdelyNTvz2UIH3PVUs\\n\\nPost 6: Excited to unveil my latest ReAct Agent project: an AI Travel Agent & Expense Planner!

But when you integrate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — especially in a custom, developer-controlled way — the level of control and reliability you unlock is game-changing.\\nIn my latest notebook, I explore two HITL implementations in LangGraph:\\nWhat’s inside this experiment?\\n** Custom HITL Implementation\\n- I designed a mechanism where HITL doesn’t rely on the built-in LangGraph pause logic — instead, developers control when and how to pause using state logic and checkpoints. This gives greater flexibility, like dynamic condition-based intervention.\\n** Built-in HITL Flow\\n- For comparison, I also implemented the traditional LangGraph HITL with pause, showing how the same flow can be controlled automatically.\\n** State update via user messages — simulating real-time human correction or approval.\\n** Why is this useful?\\n1. You can pause agents at decision points based on your custom rules (e.g., confidence, stage, error detection).\\n2. Integrate human approvals, corrections, or steering without rebuilding the agent logic.\\n3. Enable auditing or debugging of the agent\\'s reasoning by stepping in mid-run.\\n4. Build more trustworthy AI systems, especially for critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.\\nIf you\\'re working with LangGraph or building multi-agent systems, this HITL design gives you surgical control over agent reasoning.\\nHuge thanks,\\xa0Sunny Savita,\\xa0for this great session.\\nCode link:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/g-2saPBu\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangGraph\\nhashtag\\n#\\nHumanInTheLoop\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAgenticAI\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIEngineering\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangChain\\nhashtag\\n#\\nMultiAgentSystems\\nhashtag\\n#\\nMCP\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIWorkflow\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLLMOps\\nImages: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGIvunwYS0Tlg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56Zf6YaTWGUAk-/0/1752252393624?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=2LcTlpMnU5QiQBw7k2kJ6qkc-KbQLUWzSkZTDV_xGp8\\n\\nPost 5: Just completed one of the most complex projects I\\'ve worked on: an Autonomous Research Agent powered by the Hierarchical Supervisor Pattern!\\n🔍 What it does:\\n- Handles user queries end-to-end: Research → Summarize → Export\\n- Smart task routing with a top-level supervisor agent\\nTwo core teams:\\n- Research Team (Medical/Finance) using tools like Tavily & PubMed\\n- Document Processor that rewrites, summarizes & saves to PDF/DOCX\\n🛠 Tech Stack:\\n- LangGraph + LangChain tools\\n- Groq + Qwen model for fast reasoning\\n- Pydantic for structured task selection\\n- Custom tools for local file export\\n💡 Built it to explore real-world agent orchestration — and it works!\\n🔗 GitHub-notebook:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/gtz2jDq2\\nHuge thanks to\\nSunny Savita\\nand\\nKrish Naik\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangGraph\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLLM\\nhashtag\\n#\\nLangChain\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAIagent\\nhashtag\\n#\\nGroq\\nhashtag\\n#\\nPython\\nhashtag\\n#\\nAutonomousAgents\\nImages: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEYLp_mB4eYzw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZfRKZZcHoAk-/0/1751560853775?e=1764201600&v=beta&t=PtGcSm4BWRN2prLZr9JDgk2pQCdelyNTvz2UIH3PVUs\\n\\nPost 6: Excited to unveil my latest ReAct Agent project: an AI Travel Agent & Expense Planner!

      "Username: Al Amin\n",
      "\n",
      "Profile Summary:\n",
      "Al Amin presents himself as a Generative AI Engineer, deeply immersed in the cutting-edge fields of LangChain, LangGraph, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with a clear focus on architecting and building intelligent multi-agent systems. Based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he is currently contributing his expertise full-time at Genuine Technology & Research Ltd., where he is actively involved in developing and deploying these sophisticated multi-agent systems. His professional journey is underpinned by a strong academic foundation, as he is a dedicated Computer Science student at Dhaka University, having maintained an impressive CGPA of 3.80/4. His earlier education also reflects consistent academic excellence, with perfect GPA scores in both H.S.C. from Dhaka College and S.S.C. from Dhaka Residential Model College. This background highlights a persistent drive for achievement and a profound commitment to his field. His \"About\" section further elaborates on his passion, stating, \"My passion lies in creating intelligent agents that can reason, remember, and interact naturally,\" which clearly articulates his core professional interest and the direction of his work. His top skills, including RAG, AI Agents, and Python, directly align with his headline and stated passion, showcasing a coherent and focused professional identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post Summary:\n",
      "Al Amin's social media posts consistently reflect his enthusiasm, deep technical understanding, and a practical, problem-solving approach to Generative AI and agentic systems. He frequently shares his latest projects, often starting by identifying a common challenge or a compelling \"what if\" scenario, then detailing his innovative solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tackles the \"tangled mess of custom AI tool integrations\" by introducing his \"MCP Experiments-notebooks code,\" which \"pulls back the curtain by using the AI agent itself as the MCP client.\" He emphasizes simplicity and transparency, showing \"how simple it is to connect your agent to a universe of tools—no black boxes,\" and highlights key takeaways like \"Agent as the Client,\" \"LangChain & AutoGen Ready,\" and the ability to \"Easily wrap your own business logic or APIs into reusable tools.\" This demonstrates his commitment to making complex AI concepts accessible and practical for developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "His excitement is palpable when he shares his \"Multi-Model RAG pipeline,\" a project that \"understands both text and images in complex documents!\" He firmly believes that \"The future of AI is multimodal,\" and his system directly addresses this by intelligently processing PDFs and generating context-aware answers through a unified understanding of visuals and text. He meticulously outlines the architecture, from \"Unified Embeddings\" using OpenAI's CLIP to \"Intelligent Retrieval\" with FAISS, and finally \"Vision-Powered Generation\" via a vision-capable LLM like Llama, showcasing his ability to bridge different data types for smarter AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong emphasis on security and trustworthiness emerges with his \"Analyzer GPT—an autonomous agent that writes, debugs, and executes data analysis code inside a secure Docker sandbox.\" He directly addresses user caution, stating, \"You're right to be cautious about AI agents running code on your machine. So I built one that's not just smart, but safe.\" He details a secure workflow where \"The code is run inside an isolated Docker container. Zero risk to your host system,\" and highlights \"Autonomous Debugging\" and the \"Secure Docker Sandbox\" as \"non-negotiable for production-ready agents.\" This project underscores his dedication to building reliable and secure autonomous systems, a crucial step towards \"building AI agents we can trust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His exploration of \"Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\" in LangGraph further illustrates his focus on control and reliability. He poses the intriguing question, \"What if you could pause your AI agent at the perfect moment and guide it like a director on set?\" He explains how integrating HITL, especially in a \"custom, developer-controlled way,\" unlocks \"game-changing\" levels of control. His custom HITL implementation, which doesn't rely on built-in LangGraph pause logic but rather on developer-controlled state logic and checkpoints, demonstrates his desire for greater flexibility and surgical control over agent reasoning, particularly for \"critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He proudly announces the completion of \"one of the most complex projects I've worked on: an Autonomous Research Agent powered by the Hierarchical Supervisor Pattern!\" This project, designed to handle user queries end-to-end from research to summarization and export, showcases advanced agent orchestration with a top-level supervisor agent coordinating specialized teams. This highlights his ambition to tackle intricate architectural challenges and build robust, real-world agentic solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His versatility is evident in his \"AI Travel Agent & Expense Planner,\" a \"ReAct Agent project\" that applies his technical prowess to a practical, everyday problem. He details its features, including integration with \"real-time APIs for weather, Google Search, and currency conversion,\" and its ability to craft \"personalized itineraries.\" This project demonstrates his capacity to leverage complex tech stacks like Python, LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq to create dynamic and user-centric applications.\n",

      "Username: Al Amin\n",
      "\n",
      "Profile Summary:\n",
      "Al Amin presents himself as a Generative AI Engineer, deeply immersed in the cutting-edge fields of LangChain, LangGraph, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with a clear focus on architecting and building intelligent multi-agent systems. Based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he is currently contributing his expertise full-time at Genuine Technology & Research Ltd., where he is actively involved in developing and deploying these sophisticated multi-agent systems. His professional journey is underpinned by a strong academic foundation, as he is a dedicated Computer Science student at Dhaka University, having maintained an impressive CGPA of 3.80/4. His earlier education also reflects consistent academic excellence, with perfect GPA scores in both H.S.C. from Dhaka College and S.S.C. from Dhaka Residential Model College. This background highlights a persistent drive for achievement and a profound commitment to his field. His \"About\" section further elaborates on his passion, stating, \"My passion lies in creating intelligent agents that can reason, remember, and interact naturally,\" which clearly articulates his core professional interest and the direction of his work. His top skills, including RAG, AI Agents, and Python, directly align with his headline and stated passion, showcasing a coherent and focused professional identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post Summary:\n",
      "Al Amin's social media posts consistently reflect his enthusiasm, deep technical understanding, and a practical, problem-solving approach to Generative AI and agentic systems. He frequently shares his latest projects, often starting by identifying a common challenge or a compelling \"what if\" scenario, then detailing his innovative solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tackles the \"tangled mess of custom AI tool integrations\" by introducing his \"MCP Experiments-notebooks code,\" which \"pulls back the curtain by using the AI agent itself as the MCP client.\" He emphasizes simplicity and transparency, showing \"how simple it is to connect your agent to a universe of tools—no black boxes,\" and highlights key takeaways like \"Agent as the Client,\" \"LangChain & AutoGen Ready,\" and the ability to \"Easily wrap your own business logic or APIs into reusable tools.\" This demonstrates his commitment to making complex AI concepts accessible and practical for developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "His excitement is palpable when he shares his \"Multi-Model RAG pipeline,\" a project that \"understands both text and images in complex documents!\" He firmly believes that \"The future of AI is multimodal,\" and his system directly addresses this by intelligently processing PDFs and generating context-aware answers through a unified understanding of visuals and text. He meticulously outlines the architecture, from \"Unified Embeddings\" using OpenAI's CLIP to \"Intelligent Retrieval\" with FAISS, and finally \"Vision-Powered Generation\" via a vision-capable LLM like Llama, showcasing his ability to bridge different data types for smarter AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong emphasis on security and trustworthiness emerges with his \"Analyzer GPT—an autonomous agent that writes, debugs, and executes data analysis code inside a secure Docker sandbox.\" He directly addresses user caution, stating, \"You're right to be cautious about AI agents running code on your machine. So I built one that's not just smart, but safe.\" He details a secure workflow where \"The code is run inside an isolated Docker container. Zero risk to your host system,\" and highlights \"Autonomous Debugging\" and the \"Secure Docker Sandbox\" as \"non-negotiable for production-ready agents.\" This project underscores his dedication to building reliable and secure autonomous systems, a crucial step towards \"building AI agents we can trust.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His exploration of \"Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\" in LangGraph further illustrates his focus on control and reliability. He poses the intriguing question, \"What if you could pause your AI agent at the perfect moment and guide it like a director on set?\" He explains how integrating HITL, especially in a \"custom, developer-controlled way,\" unlocks \"game-changing\" levels of control. His custom HITL implementation, which doesn't rely on built-in LangGraph pause logic but rather on developer-controlled state logic and checkpoints, demonstrates his desire for greater flexibility and surgical control over agent reasoning, particularly for \"critical workflows like legal, finance, medical, or research.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He proudly announces the completion of \"one of the most complex projects I've worked on: an Autonomous Research Agent powered by the Hierarchical Supervisor Pattern!\" This project, designed to handle user queries end-to-end from research to summarization and export, showcases advanced agent orchestration with a top-level supervisor agent coordinating specialized teams. This highlights his ambition to tackle intricate architectural challenges and build robust, real-world agentic solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His versatility is evident in his \"AI Travel Agent & Expense Planner,\" a \"ReAct Agent project\" that applies his technical prowess to a practical, everyday problem. He details its features, including integration with \"real-time APIs for weather, Google Search, and currency conversion,\" and its ability to craft \"personalized itineraries.\" This project demonstrates his capacity to leverage complex tech stacks like Python, LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq to create dynamic and user-centric applications.\n",
